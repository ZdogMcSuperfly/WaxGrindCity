## A game all about grinding rails, sick scores and avoiding the police!

This game was started back in 6/2021 but was halted two months later. I'm still quite proud of what work I did get done though and feel its worth sharing the (slightly sphaghetti) source code. The game features 9 amazing totally different totally not pallete swapped levels, 69 tricks (nice!), and 3 objectives that go towards completion of the game.

This game is very much not finished and such the player should expect bugs and an inability to finish the game.
